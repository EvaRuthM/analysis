## About this repo

See analyses/ folder -- these notebooks contain charts interlaced with the code that produced them.
  * If you are not a coder, feel free to skim for text and charts only. You can also skim the plots/ directory to jump right into the pile of results.
  * If you are a coder, feel free to reproduce and alter the code for your own theories. If you identify bugs or concerns with our work, please file them as Issues so we can ensure that our results our accurate.

This is a general repository for all presentable files conducting analysis of TJI-related data. This is not a place for preprocessing steps (see [tji/data-processing](https://github.com/texas-justice-initiative/data-processing)). All data used for analysis should be read directly from data.world (see TJI's data.world account [here](https://data.world/tji)).
